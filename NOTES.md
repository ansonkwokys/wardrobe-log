# Notes for Wardrobe Log

Reason for developing Wardrobe Log:

Wardrobe Log aims to track the clothes I’ve worn, the clothes I am currently wearing, and remind me when it’s time to put items into the laundry basket after they’ve been worn for a certain period. It also provides outfit suggestions, allowing me to create different combinations every day with a limited wardrobe. In the long run, the web app will offer insights into my outfit preferences and recommend new styles based on my ratings. Additionally, it can suggest what to purchase when I buy new clothes, helping to expand my wardrobe and increase outfit possibilities.
